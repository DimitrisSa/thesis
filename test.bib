%%%  Comments
%%%  --------
%%%
%%%  - Bibliography topics:
%%%    (for fields `bibfiles' and `bibwhere')
%%%
%%%    cpp    : C++ programming etc. (DomainsC++ project)
%%%    ds     : Denotational Semantics
%%%    edd    : Electronic document delivery
%%%    educ   : Education / Hypermedia
%%%    ghinsu : Bibliography about/from the Ghinsu Project
%%%    gui    : Graphical User Interfaces
%%%    hl     : Hoare Logic
%%%    iag    : Intelligent Agents
%%%    mon    : Monads
%%%    pe     : Partial Evaluation / Program Specialization
%%%    plth   : Theory on Programming Languages / Software Engineering
%%%    sem    : Semantics (General)
%%%    sweng  : Software Engineering
%%%    trans  : Program Transformations
%%%    var    : Various
%%%    vis    : Visual Languages / Visual Programming
%%%
%%%    none   : I don't have the paper         (only for field `bibwhere')
%%%    find   : I'm trying to find the paper   (only for field `bibwhere')
%%%
%%%
%%%  - Note:
%%%
%%%    The categorization on semantics for the time being contains
%%%    only the categories `ds', `hl' and `sem'. Also, only entries
%%%    that are owned by a semantics bibliography (`ds', `hl' or
%%%    `sem') are correctly classified into these three catefories.
%%%
%%%
%%%  - Control:
%%%
%%%    Entries marked by a `bibcheck' field do not represent reliable
%%%    references. So far, the only field values are `ref', which stands
%%%    for ``check this reference'', and `cont' which stands for ``check
%%%    if the contents are OK''.

  abstract =     "The author describes an extension of the C++ programming language that allows the nesting of function definitions and provides lexical closures with dynamic lifetime. The primary motivation for this extension is that it allows the programmer to define iterators for collection classes simply as member functions. Such iterations take function pointers or closures as arguments; providing lexical closures lets one express state (e.g. accumulators) naturally and easily. He extends the C++ language without introducing new data types for closures and without affecting the efficiency of programs that do not use the feature. In order to achieve this, he proposes that when a closure is created, a short segment of code is generated that loads the static chain pointer and jumps to the body of the function. A closure is a pointer to this shorter segment of code. This trick allows him to treat a closure the same way as a pointer to an ordinary C++ function that does not reference any non-local, non-global variables. He discusses issues of consistency with existing scoping rules, syntax, allocation strategies, portability and efficiency.",

  abstract =     "Top-down (LL) context-sensitive parsers with integrated synthesis and use of attributes are easy to express in functional programming languages, but the elegant functional programming model can also serve as an exact prototype for a more efficient implementation of the technology in ANSI C. The result is a compiler-compiler that takes unlimited lookahead and backtracking, the extended BNF notation, and parameterized grammars with (higher-order) meta-parameters to the world of C programming. This article reports on the utility in question three years after public release. Precc generates standard ANSI C and is ``plug compatible'' with lex-generated lexical analyzers prepared for the UNIX yacc compiler-compiler. In contrast to yacc, however, the generated code is modular, which allows parts of scripts to be compiled separately and linked together incrementally. The constructed code is relatively efficient, as is demonstrated by the example Occam parser treated in depth here, but the main advantages we claim are ease of use, separation of specification and implementation concerns, and maintainability.",

  abstract =     "Our research focuses on the redesign of an undergraduate computer science course, Datastructures II. We are experimenting with the concept of intelligent classroom information agents (ICIA's) as a means to facilitate information and learning. It forces us to assign new roles to teachers, students and the Center for Technology in Education (CTE) staff as defined by the ICIA standard. What this implies is a drastic change in the negotiation process followed by the undergraduate agents and their peers. We emphasize a strict division between human agents and software agents, since only the former can perform real life (e.g. emotional cultural political) negotiations. The latter will remain as tools to motivate the exchange of ideas and data. Therefore, the first step in the educational process included the development of an automated lecture aid which makes extensive use of hypertext and a library style catalog of datastructure concept simulations, which we call Workplace. We are currently guiding and evaluating a cultural transformation process in which the students must re learn how to take in class notes and study with the aid of the software tools here described. We make extensive use of the Visual Basic and Visual C++ development systems, as well as of the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) framework.",

We describe a selective sample of software agents currently under development, to give an idea of the agents that will emerge in the next few years. We organize our discussion by the agents' sophistication and the degree to which they make the information superhighway disappear. Following the information superhighway metaphor, an intelligent agent may be a backseat driver who makes suggestions at every rum, a taxi driver who takes you to your destination, or even a concierge whose knowledge and skills make it unnecessary for you to approach the superhighway at all.

  abstract =     "We describe an approach to the representation and implementation of agent-based systems where the behaviour of an individual agent is represented by a set of logical rules in a particular form. This not only provides a logical specification of the agent, but also allows us to directly execute the rules in order to implement the agent's behaviour. Agents communicate with each other through a simple, and logically well-founded, broadcast communication mechanism. In addition, agents can be grouped together. This not only restricts the extent of broadcast messages, but also provides a structuring mechanism within the agent space. The purpose of this paper is threefold: to motivate the use of our particular computational model; to show that a logic-based approach is both possible and potentially very powerful; and to assert that by narrowing the gap between the agent theory and the agent programming language, we are able to bring the prospect of formal specification and verification of multi-agent systems nearer.",

(My young friend Quisani did not attend the lectures.) The present version incorporates some changes provoked by the necessity to update the bibliography. The main part of the paper is still the same, however, and the examples are unchanged even though many things happened in the meantime. In particular, we (the collective we) have learned hot to build evolving algebras by the method of successive refinements, and the current evolving algebra description of the C programming language in~[Gurevich and Huggins, 1992] doesn't look much like the strcpy example anymore. Now, we understand better how to compose evolving algebras and how to prove things with evolving algebras. A typical misconception is that the operational approach is necessarily too detailed. Some people think that an approach suited for complexity analysis does not give a good high-level specification language. I believe in a high-level specification language based on evolving algebras; the successive refinement method is then one tool to prove implementation correctness. But this and various other issues (how to incorporate real time into evolving algebras for example) will have to addressed elsewhere.",

After surveying developments in the concrete theory of domains we describe two newer developments, the axiomatic and the synthetic approach. In the second part we look at three computational phenomena in detail, namely, sequential computation, polymorphism, and mutable state, and at the challenges that these pose for a mathematical model.",

The multiparadigm language Leda allows access to the imperative, logic, functional, and object-oriented paradigms within one programming language. Here we describe the experience of implementing a compiler for a subset of the language C using Leda, and examine how access to several paradigms affected our design and implementation.",

  abstract =     "C and C++ allow passing functions as arguments to other functions in the form of function pointers. However, since function pointers can refer only to existing functions declared at global or file scope, these function arguments cannot capture local environments. This leads to the common misconception that C and C++ do not support function closures. In fact, function closures can be modeled directly in C++ by enclosing a function inside an object such that the local environment is captured by data members of the object. This idiom is described in advanced C++ texts and is used, for example, to implement callbacks. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate how this idiom can be generalized to a type-safe framework of C++ class templates for higher-order functions that support composition and partial application. Second, we explore the expressiveness of the framework and compare it with that of existing functional programming languages. We illustrate by means of various examples that object-oriented and functional idioms can coexist productively and can be used to enhance the functionality of common classes, for example, of nonlinear collections such as trees. A C++ implementation of the framework is available on request.",

A key component in this architecture is the context mediator, an intelligent agent which performs data conversions between the source and the receiver. We are concerned with what a context mediator 'knows' and how it 'behaves' from an external perspective. We introduce the notion of a conversion axiom, which is a formal and declarative means of specifying knowledge required by the mediator to perform desired conversions. We also state, in formal terms, the behavior of the mediator which uses conversion knowledge to translate data from the source context to the receiver context. Formal characterizations of what a context mediator should know and its external behavior provide a specification for the subsequent design of the knowledge representation and reasoning processes internal to the mediator. This approach draws upon ideas and concepts discussed in Mario Bunge's Ontology and Semantics (1974; 1977).",

Program slicing (as well as other program analysis functions including ripple analysis) can be efficiently performed on an internal program representation called a system dependence graph (SDG). This paper will describe a new method for calculating transitive dependencies in the presence of recursion. This method requires neither the (explicit) calculation of the GMOD and GREF sets nor the construction of a linkage grammar and the corresponding subordinate characteristic graphs of the linkage grammar's non-terminals. Additionally, a beneficial side effect of this method is that it provides us with a new method for performing interprocedural, flow-sensitive data flow analysis. Finally, this paper will illustrate the versatility of the SDG as an internal program representation by briefly describing a tool that we have developed that permits slicing, dicing, ripple analysis, and other static analysis functions to be performed on programs written in a subset of ANSI C (e.g., C without gotos and pointers).",

Its functionality appears comparable to other agent architectures in the literature, including the incorporation of a reactive element. Novelties in the architecture include ``cognitive reactivity'', a formal notion of relevance, and attention, and a control regime based on these. An initial implementation is briefly described.",

The issues are illustrated initially in the context of the complex agent-ESS interactions in an engineering design example. Approaching the area from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI) research, the authors find that in general, agent-ESS interactions vary widely. They characterize the possible variations in terms of performance capabilities required, skill levels at which performance is exhibited, and knowledge sources from which capabilities can be acquired. They are exploring these variations using Soar as the candidate AI agent; the document briefly describes seven Soar-based projects in early stages of development, in which agent-ESS issues are addressed. They conclude by placing agent-ESS research in the context of other work on software technology, and discuss the research agenda in this area.",

The change in emphasis would be from just acquiring selected skills and knowledge to the development of capacities which enable people to learn continuously for the rest of their lives. This evolutionary step is vital to the continued health of human societies in a post-modern age of rapid change where the certainties of the past are being replaced by the uncertainties of a future that requires continuous learning. The move to a learning society requires changes in both personal attitudes and the educational infrastructure. It also requires major technological support to provide open access to a learning environment for all people, in all places at all times. The paper describes the development of the Learning Web, an agent-oriented network supporting knowledge access, collaboration and simulation, in order to provide a widely accessible learning environment. The essence of the Learning Web is an open architecture supporting integration of heterogeneous subsystems in which there is a natural symbiosis between human and computer agents.",

New linguistics constructs are defined for object level programming with String and Splurge functions treating object visibility and messages. Treating objects as abstract data types and a two level programming approach to OOP allows us to define Pullup abstractions to treat incompatible objects. The techniques open new areas of research on object level programming to pursue, and put us at MJOOP, the Multiagent Junction For OOP.",

  abstract =     "C State Transformers (CST) is an expression-oriented dialect of C, designed to smoothly integrate functional programming into C-based software. CST is an attempt to do for functional programming what C++ did for object-oriented programming. It provides support for functional programming with a C-like syntax. In many ways, CST programs are similar to C programs. Data definitions and function declarations have the same syntax and semantics. CST uses C`s type system. CST programs require the same run-time system as C programs. A CST compiler can be implemented by the composition of a preprocessor and a C compiler. In contrast with C, the body of a CST function definition is an expression. CST has no statements and its iteration construct produces a value upon termination. CST allows purely functional computations to be specified in a natural, expression-oriented manner. CST`s support for functional programming is limited, due to the requirement that there be a simple translation of the language into C. As a result, CST programs must explicitly manage heap storage, and a function cannot be the result of another function if its body references a local variable in the producing function. The limitations on functional programming allow the seamless integration of CST modules into C programs. As an added bonus, the language is simpler than C.",

The esh Scheme data formats, run-time system, and packaging were designed to be highly compatible with C and Unix. Scheme supports all C functions and data structures as first-class objects. Based on information obtained from the dynamic linker and from applying an interface compiler to C header files, esh Scheme creates tagged references to arbitrary C values as needed. System interfaces are transliterated from ANSI C into Scheme by a set of rules and conventions designed to express typical ANSI C interfaces concisely and naturally in Scheme's function-oriented style. The conventions also make it easy for a C programmer to understand esh Scheme programs. The main work in designing the interface between any two languages is reconciling their data models. This is done by putting data and function values into three categories: peculiar to one language, and not legal at cross-language interfaces; peculiar to one language, but representable in the other; and treated as common to both languages.",

By modeling representation of instances in terms of existential types, we obtain a simplified model, and build a basis for defining subtyping among algebraic domains. The inheritance at category level has been formalized; this allows the automatic inference of type classes. By means of type classes and existential types we construct subtype relations without involving coercions. A type sharing mechanism works in parallel and allows the consistent extension and combination of domains. The expressiveness of the system is further increased by viewing domain types as special case of package types, forming weak and strong sums respectively. The introduced system, although awkward at first sight, is simpler than other proposed systems for computer algebra without including some of their problems. The system can be further extended in order to support more constructs and increase its flexibility.",

  abstract =     "The fundamental idea underlying agent-oriented programming (AOP) (Shoham, 1993) is that agents are modeled in terms of their ``mental states'' (consisting in this work of beliefs, plans, capabilities, and intentions), both by other agents and by their designers and programmers. An agent program gives the agent's initial mental state and rules describing a transition function: given an agent's current state and input, the rules specify its new state and output. An agent's communicative acts, then, are actions that affect the mental states of the agents involved, just as physical actions affect the agent's physical environment. We present and discuss a new agent-oriented programming language, PLACA, a descendant of AGENT0. Unlike AGENT0, PLACA capitalizes on agents' planning abilities. Assuming that all agents have at least elementary planning abilities, PLACA agents can make high-level requests of each other without worrying about how these requests will be carried out. We describe PLACA, show a short example program, briefly describe a PLACA interpreter, and discuss the mental states of agents.",

Possible agent tasks include supporting navigation and browsing; simplifying information retrieval; sorting, organizing, and indexing user-jobs; and filtering information from large databases. BASAR's interface is based on the concept of indirect management.

The types of a program reflect which effects occur. The first section is an extended example of the use of monads.

AgentSpeak can model distributed autonomous agents, situated in dynamic environments, that are reactive as well as proactive towards the environment. Agents are organized into agent families offering certain services to other agents. Services are realized through the execution of an associated plan. Each agent will also be associated with a database. Some of the services, and a portion of the database could be public; i.e. available outside the agent. Therefore it follows that the remainder of the database, the remaining services and all of the plans will be private to the agent family. The language supports and extends concurrent object-oriented language features such as synchronous and asynchronous messages and has well developed group communication primitives.",

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.",
